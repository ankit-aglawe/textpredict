## Advanced Text Classification with Transformer Models

<!-- </div> -->

TextPredict is a powerful Python package designed for various text analysis and prediction tasks using advanced NLP models. It simplifies the process of performing sentiment analysis, emotion detection, zero-shot classification, named entity recognition (NER), and more. Built on top of Hugging Face's Transformers, TextPredict allows seamless integration with pre-trained models or custom models for specific tasks.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment of text (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Emotion Detection**: Identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
- **Zero-Shot Classification**: Classify text into custom categories without additional training.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract entities like names, locations, and organizations from text.
- **Sequence Classification**: Fine-tune models for custom classification tasks.
- **Token Classification**: Classify tokens within text for tasks like NER.
- **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)**: Perform tasks like translation and summarization.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate and compare multiple models on the same dataset.
- **Explainability**: Understand model predictions through feature importance analysis.
- **Text Cleaning**: Utilize utility functions for preprocessing text data.

## Supported Tasks

- Sentiment Analysis
- Emotion Detection
- Zero-Shot Classification
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sequence Classification
- Token Classification
- Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)
